# Stellar_Classification
Comparing K-Nearest Neighbours and Neural Network for classifying stellar objects.

## Dataset

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17)

## Results

Through tweaking the hiperparameters of both the KNN and NN models I was able to achieve about 94% accuracy rate for both of them.  
After analyzing them both, I have concluded that KNN is better suited for this task, as it provides good accuracy more consistently than the NN model.
